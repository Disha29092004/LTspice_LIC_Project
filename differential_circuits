# DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER : <br>
<br>
1. A differential pair amplifier, also called a long-tailed pair.<br>
2. Differential pair amplifier is a fundamental circuit in analog electronics, especially in operational amplifiers and differential signal processing.<br>
3. It consists of two transistors that share a common current source and amplify the difference between two input signals.<br>
<br>

## BASIC STRUCTURE : <br>
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e25c387-15ff-417e-bf8e-a23af72440ad)
1. Two NMOS transistors with their sources tied together.<br>
2. A current source at the sources.<br>
3. Outputs taken from the drains.<br>
<br>

### WORKING PRINCIPLE : <br>
1. It receives two input signals (Vin1 and Vin2).<br>
2. The circuit amplifies the difference between these signals, rejecting common-mode noise.<br>
3. A constant current source in the emitter ensures proper operation.<br>
<br>

## CIRCUIT 1 : Resistor-Loaded Differential Pair:<br>

### DC Analysis :<br>
1. The DC operating points are determined.
* Objective: Ensure both transistors are in saturation.
* Vary W/L to get the required Voutcm. <br>
* Vary Rd to set exact Voutcm.<br>
* Results:<br>
  Drain current (Id) is split between the two MOSFETs.<br>
  Drain-to-source voltage (Vds) is checked to ensure saturation.<br>

##### Theoretical values and observed values of parameters :<br>

| Parameter    | Theoretical value  | Practical value |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
|Voutcm        | 1.25V              | 1.250V          |
|Vp            | 0.4V               | 0.4V           |
|Id1,Id2       | 0.5mA              | 4.9mA          |
|Id(V1)        | 1mA                | 0.99mA          |
|Rd            | 1.9kohm            | 1.9kohm        |
|Rss           | 400.0ohm           | 400ohm          |
|Vgs           | 0.8V               | 0.801V          |
