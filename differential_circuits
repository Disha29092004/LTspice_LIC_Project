# DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER : <br>
<br>
1. A differential pair amplifier, also called a long-tailed pair.<br>
2. Differential pair amplifier is a fundamental circuit in analog electronics, especially in operational amplifiers and differential signal processing.<br>
3. It consists of two transistors that share a common current source and amplify the difference between two input signals.<br>
<br>

## BASIC STRUCTURE : <br>
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e25c387-15ff-417e-bf8e-a23af72440ad)
1. Two NMOS transistors with their sources tied together.<br>
2. A current source at the sources.<br>
3. Outputs taken from the drains.<br>
<br>

### WORKING PRINCIPLE : <br>
1. It receives two input signals (Vin1 and Vin2).<br>
2. The circuit amplifies the difference between these signals, rejecting common-mode noise.<br>
3. A constant current source in the emitter ensures proper operation.<br>
