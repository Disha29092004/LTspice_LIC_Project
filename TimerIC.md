#  Monostable and Astable Multivibrator using 555 Timer IC

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **design, simulation, and analysis** of Monostable and Astable Multivibrator circuits using the popular **555 Timer IC**. Both configurations are used to generate timed pulses, which are essential in digital logic, timer circuits, and oscillators.

The project involves:
- Designing monostable and astable circuits
- Simulating their behavior in virtual environments
- Observing and documenting the waveform outputs
- Creating a pulse of **0.5 ms width**
- Utilizing differentiator and clipper circuits for trigger generation

##  Aim

> To generate a pulse of **0.5 ms** duration using a **555 Timer IC** in both **monostable** and **astable** modes.

---

##  Theoretical Background

### 1. Monostable Multivibrator
- Has **one stable** and **one quasi-stable** state.
- Requires an **external trigger** to change the state.
- After a specific time, it reverts to the stable state.

**Time period (pulse width)**:  
\[
T = 1.1 \times R \times C
\]

- **R** is the resistance in ohms.
- **C** is the capacitance in farads.
- Output is HIGH for `T` seconds after a trigger pulse.

### 2. Astable Multivibrator
- A free-running oscillator (no stable state).
- Continuously alternates between HIGH and LOW states.
- Used to generate square or rectangular waves.

**Time period**:  
\[
T = 0.693 \times (R_a + 2R_b) \times C
\]

**Duty Cycle**:
\[
\text{D} = \frac{R_a + R_b}{R_a + 2R_b} \times 100\%
\]

Where:
- Ra = Resistor connected between Vcc and discharge pin
- Rb = Resistor between discharge pin and threshold pin
- C = Timing capacitor

### 3. Differentiator Circuit
- A capacitor-resistor circuit that responds to **changes in voltage**.
- Produces **short pulses** on rising/falling edges.
- Helps in extracting trigger pulses for monostable circuits.

### 4. Negative Clipper
- Removes negative portions of an input signal.
- Ensures only the **positive edge triggers** the monostable.

##  Simulation Procedure

### Using Virtual Labs / Proteus / Tinkercad:
1. **Connect circuit** as per diagrams using the 555 timer.
2. Set values:
   - Monostable: R = 4.5kΩ, C = 0.1µF
   - Astable: Ra = 3.3kΩ, Rb = 6.8kΩ, C = 0.1µF
3. Use waveform generator or differentiator + clipper as trigger source.
4. Observe and capture waveforms using oscilloscope tool.
5. Measure time intervals using cursors.
6. Repeat with different values for RC to verify time period formula.

##  Calculations

### Monostable Time Duration:
\[
T = 1.1 \times R \times C = 1.1 \times 4.5k\Omega \times 0.1\mu F = 0.495 \, ms
\]

### Astable Time Period:
\[
T = 0.693 \times (Ra + 2Rb) \times C = 0.693 \times (3.3k + 2 \times 6.8k) \times 0.1\mu F = 1.27 \, ms
\]

| Case 1        | Standard Astable + Monostable | 0.2 ms      | 0.3 ms       | Good for basic square wave gen. |
| Case 2        | High-speed astable setup      | 0.05 ms     | 0.05 ms      | Stable only with precision parts|

##  Inference

- Monostable multivibrator produces a **single fixed-width pulse** on trigger.
- Astable multivibrator creates a **continuous square wave** without trigger.
- Output duration is highly dependent on **RC constants**.
- 555 Timer provides a cost-effective solution for waveform generation.
- Additional shaping circuits like differentiators and clippers are essential for clean triggering in practical systems.
- Output waveform characteristics match theoretical predictions.
