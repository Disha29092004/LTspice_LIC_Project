# CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) — With and Without Miller Compensation

This project presents a detailed comparative study of two CMOS OTA designs:
- A **traditional Miller-compensated OTA**.
- A **novel non-Miller compensated OTA** utilizing an RC network implemented using MOSFETs.

Developed using **TSMC 180 nm CMOS technology** and simulated in **LTspice**, this study aims to evaluate performance trade-offs in terms of gain, power, phase margin, and bandwidth.

##  Project Objectives

- Design and simulate two-stage CMOS OTAs.
- Evaluate the impact of Miller vs. non-Miller compensation techniques.
- Measure and compare:
  - DC gain
  - Slew rate (SR)
  - Phase margin (PM)
  - Gain-bandwidth product (GBW)
  - Power consumption

##  Background

Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs) are widely used in analog filters, ADCs, and other analog interfaces. Two-stage OTAs are typically compensated using the **Miller technique**, but this introduces a **Right Half Plane (RHP) zero**, which degrades phase margin and limits performance under capacitive loads.

To address these limitations, a **non-Miller design** using a **MOSFET-based RC compensation network** was proposed to:
- Eliminate the RHP zero.
- Improve slew rate.
- Reduce power consumption.
- Offer better phase margin scalability.

##  Design Overview

###  Miller Compensated OTA

- **Stage 1**: Differential NMOS input (M1–M2) with PMOS active loads (M3–M4).
- **Stage 2**: Common-source amplifier (M7) with PMOS load (M6).
- **Compensation**: 2 pF Miller capacitor connected between gate and drain of M7.
- **Supply voltage**: 1.8V
- **Bias current**: 250 µA

###  Non-Miller Compensated OTA (Class A-AB)

- Dual input: NMOS + PMOS differential pairs.
- Output RC network:
  - **RZ** = MOSFET transmission gate (MZ2, MZ3)
  - **CZ** = Gate-source capacitance of MZ1
- Dominant pole at output.
- Slew enhancement through voltage boosting at internal nodes (A, B, C).

##  Key Equations

### Gain
Av = gm × ro
gm = 2 × Id / Vov
ro = 1 / λId



### Slew Rate
SR = I_bias / C_load


### Bandwidth and Compensation
- For Miller OTA:
f_D = 1 / (2π R_out C_Miller)
Zero at: f_RHPZ ≈ gm / C_Miller

- For Non-Miller OTA:
Compensation zero = 1 / (RZ × CZ)

##  Circuit Schematics

### Miller Compensated
Input (NMOS diff pair) -> Common Source Stage -> Miller Capacitor -> Output


### Non-Miller Compensated

##  Conclusion

- **Miller OTA**: High gain and good stability but consumes more power and suffers from limited slew rate.
- **Non-Miller OTA**: Better phase margin, faster transient response, and lower power — ideal for high-speed low-power applications.
